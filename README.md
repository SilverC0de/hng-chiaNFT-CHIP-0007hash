# ‚ú® CHIP-0007 sha256 CSV processor
Backend system processing CSV files to create a CHIP-0007 JSON data and then calculate the sha256 hash of the JSON then append the hash to the CSV file.
Sounds like a lot but its nothing, please read through and give a star rating.

#
## üòå For non technical users

What the system does
1. Accept a csv file by uploading to https://hng-chianft-chip-0007hash.vercel.app/upload using the *file* key
2. Runs through the CSV file and gets each row
3. Converts each row to a Chia CHIP-0007 JSON format
4. Convert the JSON data to sha256 and append it to CSV file
5. Creates a download link for the new CSV file as team.output.csv

#
## üßô For CLI users

If you want to use the command line interface, you need to have Nodejs installed, you can download Nodejs [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

1. ``git clone https://github.com/SilverC0de/hng-chiaNFT-CHIP-0007hash``
2. ``cd hng-chiaNFT-CHIP-0007hash``
3. Make sure the CSV file is added to the directory
4. ``npm i``
5. ``npm run cli``
6. Follow the CLI prompts
7. Your processed CSV file will now be found in the directory as `nftx.output.csv`

#
## üë©‚Äçü¶∞ For frontend devs

1. Build a file upload interface that accept CSV file
2. Send the uploaded CSV file to the endpoint as explained below
    - Endpoint is https://hng-chianft-chip-0007hash.vercel.app/upload
    - Method is a **POST request**
    - Body type is **form-data**
    - Key is **file**
3. It will send back a response containing the download link to the new CSV file with sha256 hash of the JSON NFT data.


sample response
```json
{
    "status": true,
    "message": "New CSV file has been generated successfully",
    "link": "https://hng-chianft-chip-0007hash.vercel.app/download/nft.output.csv"
}
```


#
## ü•∑ For backend devs

This repository allows you convert json data to sha256

1. Make sure you're running Node.js on your system
2. ``git clone https://github.com/SilverC0de/hng-chiaNFT-CHIP-0007hash``
3. ``cd hng-chiaNFT-CHIP-0007hash``
4. ``npm i``
5. Open Postman and make a POST request to http://localhost:8880/upload with your CSV file using form-data with key *file*
6. It will return a new CSV file link containing sha256 hash of the NFTs
7. You can also access the CSV file from the directory as `nft.output.csv`

The structure of the JSON file for each NFT before hashing
```json
{
    "format": "CHIP-0007",
    "name": "Name of the NFT",
    "description": "Description of the NFT",
