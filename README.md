# âœ¨ CHIP-0007 sha256 CSV processor
Backend system processing CSV files to create a CHIP-0007 JSON data and then calculate the sha256 hash of the JSON then append the hash to the CSV file.
Sounds like a lot but its nothing, please read through and give a star rating.

#
## ðŸ˜Œ For non technical users

What the system does
1. Accept a csv file by uploading to http://localhost:8880/upload using the *file* key
2. Runs through the CSV file and gets each row
3. Converts each row to a Chia CHIP-0007 JSON format
4. Convert the JSON data to sha256 and append it to CSV file
5. Creates a download link for the new CSV file as `nftx.output.csv` or `nft.output.csv` depending on weather you used cli or run it as a local server

#
## ðŸ§™ For CLI users

If you want to use the command line interface, you need to have Nodejs installed, you can download Nodejs [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

1. ``git clone https://github.com/SilverC0de/hng-chiaNFT-CHIP-0007hash``
2. ``cd hng-chiaNFT-CHIP-0007hash``
3. Make sure the CSV file is added to the directory
4. ``npm i``
5. ``npm run cli``
6. Follow the CLI prompts
7. Your processed CSV file will now be found in the directory as `nftx.output.csv`


#
## ðŸ¥· For backend devs

This repository allows you convert json data to sha256

1. Make sure you're running Node.js on your system
2. ``git clone https://github.com/SilverC0de/hng-chiaNFT-CHIP-0007hash``
3. ``cd hng-chiaNFT-CHIP-0007hash``
4. ``npm i``
5. ``npm start``
6. Open Postman and make a POST request to http://localhost:8880/upload with your CSV file using form-data with key **file**
7. It will return a new CSV file link containing sha256 hash of the NFTs
8. You can also access the CSV file from the directory as `nft.output.csv`
