# ‚ú® CHIP-0007 sha256 CSV processor
Backend system processing CSV files to create a CHIP-0007 JSON data and then calculate the sha256 hash of the JSON then append the hash to the CSV file.
Sounds like a lot but its nothing, please read through and give a star rating.

######
## üòå For non technical users

What the system does
1. Accept a csv file by uploading to https://hng-chianft-chip-0007hash.vercel.app/upload using the *file* key
2. Runs through the CSV file and gets each row
3. Converts each row to a Chia CHIP-0007 JSON format
4. Convert the JSON data to sha256 and append it to CSV file
5. Creates a download link for the new CSV file as team.output.csv


######
## üë©‚Äçü¶∞ For frontend devs

1. Build a file upload interface that accept CSV file
2. Send the uploaded CSV file to the endpoint as explained below
    - Endpoint is **https://hng-chianft-chip-0007hash.vercel.app/upload**
    - Method is a **POST request**
    - Body type is **form-data**
    - Key is **file**
3. It will send back a response containing the download link to the new CSV file with sha256 hash of the JSON NFT data.

```json
{
    "status": true,
    "message": "New CSV file has been generated successfully",
    "link": "https://hng-chianft-chip-0007hash.vercel.app/bin/team.output.csv"
}

## ü•∑ For backend devs

This repository allows you convert json data to sha256

1. Make sure you're running Node.js on your system
2. ``git clone https://github.com/SilverC0de/hng-chiaNFT-CHIP-0007hash``
3. ``cd hng-chiaNFT-CHIP-0007hash``
4. ``npm i``
5. Open Postman and make a POST request to http://localhost:8880/upload with your CSV file using form-data with key *file*
6. It will return a new CSV file containing sha256 hash of the NFTs
